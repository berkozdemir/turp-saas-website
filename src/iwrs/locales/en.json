    },
    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is randomization and why is it important?",
        "answer": "Randomization is the process of randomly assigning patients to treatment arms in clinical trials. This method ensures comparability between study groups and eliminates selection bias. Omega CRO IWRS platform supports simple randomization, block randomization, stratified randomization, and adaptive randomization methods. Our AI-powered system recommends optimal randomization strategies and monitors balance in real-time."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What is the difference between block randomization and stratified randomization?",
        "answer": "Block randomization ensures balanced allocation within blocks of a certain number of patients and maintains numerical balance between treatment groups. Stratified randomization divides patients into subgroups based on important prognostic factors (such as age, gender, disease stage) and applies separate randomization within each subgroup. Omega CRO IWRS supports both methods and even allows you to combine them for 'stratified block randomization'."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How does adaptive randomization work?",
        "answer": "Adaptive randomization learns from data collected as the study progresses and dynamically adjusts randomization ratios. For example, if better results are seen in one treatment arm than expected, the system can assign more patients to that arm. Omega CRO's AI-powered module suggests adaptive strategies through real-time data analysis, implements these strategies after ethics committee approval, and documents all changes in detail."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What are the main features of the IWRS system?",
        "answer": "Omega CRO IWRS (Interactive Web Response System) offers central randomization, drug supply management, patient enrollment tracking, site management, real-time reporting, and GCP-compliant audit trail features. The system is accessible 24/7, has multilingual support, and can be used from all devices (computer, tablet, phone). It is fully compliant with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and EMA requirements."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How is IMP (Investigational Medicinal Product) supply management done with IWRS?",
        "answer": "The IWRS system tracks each site's drug inventory in real-time, predicts future needs based on patient randomization rate, and automatically generates resupply alerts. Our AI module analyzes historical study data to suggest optimal stock levels, applies FEFO (First Expired, First Out) principle based on expiration dates, and minimizes waste. Additionally, special tracking and alarm systems are available for drugs requiring cold chain."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What happens if a protocol amendment is needed during the study?",
        "answer": "Omega CRO IWRS has a flexible structure to manage protocol amendments. When changes are needed in critical parameters such as randomization algorithm, number of treatment arms, stratification factors, the system maintains full data integrity before and after the change. All changes are recorded in the audit trail and detailed documentation is provided for submission to regulatory authorities. Validation tests are performed automatically."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What features does the warehouse module include?",
        "answer": "The warehouse module offers real-time inventory tracking, barcode/RFID integration, expiration date management, cold chain monitoring (2-8°C, -20°C, -80°C), automatic stock alerts, drug dispensing according to FEFO principle, detailed inventory reports, and GCP-compliant audit trail. In multi-center studies, central warehouse and site-based stock management is available."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "How is cold chain tracking done?",
        "answer": "Our system provides 24/7 temperature and humidity monitoring with IoT sensors. When specified limits are exceeded, automatic SMS, email, and mobile app notifications are sent. All temperature data is recorded and reported on a second-by-second basis. Emergency action plans are activated in critical situations such as power outages or freezer failures. All required documentation for regulatory audits can be presented ready."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What is done in case of a drug recall?",
        "answer": "In case of a recall, the IWRS system immediately identifies all drugs with the relevant lot/batch number and shows which sites they are at. The system automatically sends notifications to all relevant sites, marks the drugs in question as 'unusable', and provides a list for patient communication. All transactions are recorded in the audit trail and documentation required for regulatory reporting is automatically generated."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "How is data security ensured?",
        "answer": "Omega CRO has an ISO 27001 certified information security management system. Data is protected with 256-bit AES encryption, encryption is applied both in the database (at rest) and during transmission (in transit). Multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), and regular penetration tests are performed. All servers are hosted in secure, geographically distributed data centers."
      },
      "q11": {
        "question": "How is KVKK and GDPR compliance ensured?",
        "answer": "Our system is fully compliant with KVKK and GDPR requirements for personal data protection. Patient information texts, explicit consent management, data subject rights (access, correction, deletion, data portability), data processing inventory, data breach notification mechanisms are integrated. Regular KVKK/GDPR compliance audits are conducted and all necessary documentation is provided."
      },
      "q12": {
        "question": "What is FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance?",
        "answer": "FDA 21 CFR Part 11 is the US regulation for electronic records and electronic signatures. Omega CRO IWRS is fully compliant with this regulation: immutable audit trail, electronic signature validation, user access control, data integrity, system validation, and regular backups are performed. All critical transactions are approved with electronic signatures and system validation documentation is kept ready."
